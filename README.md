# SpringBootJPA-mysql_skeleton
SpringBoot initializer created project with settings and sql for connecting to a MySQL database

This is just a repository that I use for reference, when creating Spring Boot projects with a MySQL connection. This project contains a pom file and properties file for using jpa with mysqq. It also has an sql script that can be used for creating the necessary 
mysql database and user.
